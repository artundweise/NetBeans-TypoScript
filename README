This Project aims to provide support for the TypoScript Language used by TYPO3. 

The currently implemented features are:
- Syntax highlighting (based on the file tokenizetyposcript.js form the TYPO3 extension t3editor).
- a navigator for alle properties declared in a file
- a check for syntax errors (thanks to familie-redlich)
- Code-Folding
- a parser, responsible for syntax errors, navigator an other things
- Code-Completion
